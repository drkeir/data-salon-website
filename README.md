# Data Salon Website

Repo for the public facing website for the _Data Salon_ (https://data-salon.org)

The Sydney Cultural Data Salon is a bi-monthly meeting for cultural workers and institutions interested or involved in the use of cultural data.

It provides a unique forum to share experiences, approaches, strategies and tools. With invited talks and discussion opportunities the salon series explores how data-led research and innovation can inform a holistic view of visitor expectations and experience to inform strategic planning and daily decision making.

The salons began in early 2019 and are co-convened by Dr. Keir Winesmith and Dr. Lizzie Muller.

The series is supported by the Sydney Culture Network and the UNSW Art & Design.

The website is a basic (single page) brochure style site with event listing, previous event briefing notes and a signup form (MailChimp).
